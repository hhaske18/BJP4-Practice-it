/*The PointClient program is supposed to construct two Point objects, 
translate each, and then print their coordinates. The expected output is 
shown below. Finish the program so that it runs properly.

p1 is (8, 2)
p2 is (4, 3)
p1's distance from origin is 8.246211251235321
p1 is now (9, 4)
p2 is now (3, 13)*/

Answer:
public class PointClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Point p1 = new Point();
        p1.x = 8;
        p1.y = 2;
        Point p2 = new Point();
        p2.x = 4;
        p2.y = 3;

        System.out.println("p1 is "+p1.toString());
        System.out.println("p2 is "+p2.toString());

        System.out.println("p1's distance from origin is " + p1.distanceFromOrigin());

        p1.translate(1, 2);
        p2.translate(-1, 10);

        System.out.println("p1 is now " + p1);
        System.out.println("p2 is now " + p2);
    }
}
