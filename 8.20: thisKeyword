/*What is the meaning of the keyword 'this', and how can the keyword be used? Check all that apply.*/

Answer:
The keyword this refers to the object on which a method or constructor has been called (sometimes called the "implicit parameter"). 
It is used to access or set the object's field values, 
to call the object's methods, 
or to call one constructor from another.
